<h5>Station 1</h5>
<p>Congratulations! You've enrolled in a market livestock 4-H project! Taking care of a market project can be tough but
    it sure is rewarding!

    You're about to go see the breeder where you're picking out your project when you look around your project's future
    pen. You notice that there's a broken panel with sharp edges sticking out and last year's dirty bedding is still in
    there.

    If you think your project will be fine in there and leave to go buy your animal go to station # 2.

    If you decide to fix the broken panel and clean out the dirty bedding, go to station #3.
