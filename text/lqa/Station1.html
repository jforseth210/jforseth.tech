<h5>Station 1</h5>
<p>Congratulations!  Youve enrolled in a 4-H market animal project.  Taking care of a market animal project will be hard work, but rewarding and fun, too.
    You are on your way to pick up your market animal from the breeder.  You look into the pen where youll keep your animal and notice a broken panel with sharp edges sticking out and dirty bedding from last year on the ground.
