<p>Your animal switched to finisher successfully and is gaining weight for the fair!

    Unfortunately, your animal gets sick (this can happen to even the most experienced people). You call the vet and
    they have you treat your animal with penicillin. A copy of the label will either be shown here or sent by email with
    a treatment record. Finish filling out the treatment record for your animal and email it to teton@montana.edu
