<h5>Station 3</h5>
<p>Your project animal will like the safe pen and clean bedding!
    Your animal is used to its new pen, so you decide to start training it how to walk properly. It is stubborn and won't
    walk with you!
    <ul>
        <li>
           A: You remain calm and keep working patiently with your animal. It will take time to train your animal.
        </li>
        <li>
           B: You are so frustrated that you yell at your animal and kick at it as hard as you can.
        </li>
    </ul>
