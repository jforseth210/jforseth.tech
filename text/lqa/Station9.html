<h5>Station 9</h5>
<p>Your buyer calls you a month after fair looking for your treatment record, which you threw out already. You say you remember that you gave your animal penicillin but you don't know the lot number and you can't remember what day. Your buyer isn't happy that you don't have that information and says they won't buy a 4-H animal ever again.

    Make a mental note to hang on to treatment records for 3 years after you treat the animal and  continue.</p>
