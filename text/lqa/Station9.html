<h5>Station 9</h5>
<p>Your buyer calls you a month after fair looking for your treatment record, which you threw out already. You tell your buyer that you remember giving your animal penicillin.  You don't know the lot number and you can't remember what day you gave your animal the penicillin. Your buyer isn't happy that you don't have that information and says they won't buy a 4-H animal ever again.
    From now on, you will keep the treatment records for three years after you treat any animal.
