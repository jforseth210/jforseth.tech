<h5>Station 2</h5>
<p>Almost as soon as it got off the trailer, your project cut itself on the panel and then developed an infection from the dirty bedding. You couldn't keep the infection from spreading and your project animal died. Good thing you bought a spare.

    After fixing up your pen and cleaning out the dirty bedding-go to station # 3 and try to keep your spare alive.
