<h5>Station 2</h5>
<p>Your animal is nervous and runs out of the trailer and cuts itself on broken panel.  It develops an infection from the dirty bedding.  You cannot keep the infection from spreading and your animal dies.  Good thing you bought a buddy animal.
    After you fix up your pen and clean up the dirty bedding, continue on.
