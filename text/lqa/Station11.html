<h5>Station 11</h5>
<p>Someone took a video of you kicking your animal and posted it on social media. You call them right away and ask them to take it down. They agree as long as you send them an essay you wrote about why animal abuse is wrong.

    Breathe a sigh of release that you got off that easy, make a promise to yourself to be more patient with your projects, and continue.
