<p>Your animal is drinking the clean water and is feeling much better.
    As the project year goes on, you decide it's time to switch from a grower feed to a finisher feed to get your animal finished in time for fair.

        <li>
          A: You mix finisher feed in with the grower feed slowly to get your animal used to the change in feed.
        </li>
        <li>
           B: You feed your animal the rest of the grower feed, and then switch to the finisher feed.
