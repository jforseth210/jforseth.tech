# jforseth.tech
This is the github repo for my personal website, which I use to experiment with python, html, css, and javascript. Well, I really just copy-paste the javascript, but can you blame me?
# Installation
This is my website. If you want to run it on your own server, don't. That's just weird.
# Usage
Again, this is a website. You use it by going to jforseth.tech and using it. 
# Liscense
This code comes with no liscense or warrenty. If you want to use my code, please contact me directly. If you want to use my site, use it at your own risk. I make no promises of security, privacy, or even basic functionality. I am an amatuer and this is an experiment. If you use it, great, if you don't, makes no difference to me. But please, for my sake and yours, don't depend on it. This code is insecure, buggy, and running on old hardware.
