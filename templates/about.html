<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>I created this website to see if I could. I couldn't (without help), but once I got it up an running, I had the idea of creating a website for exchanging prayer requests in my church group. The site is still mostly used for that, but I use it for all sorts of side projects, like my video editing, various coding experiments.</p>
<br />
<h2>How To:</h2>
<h3>Recieve prayer requests:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Type in your email address where it says "Or be notified when someone requests prayer:"</li>
    <li>If you were given a code, type it in the box that say "PARISH". Otherwise leave this blank.</li>
    <li>Click submit</li>
    <li>Check your email. There should be a message from 406prayerrequests@gmail.com.</li>
    <li>Open the message. Click the verify button at the buttom.</li>
    <li>Congrats. You will now recieve prayer requests.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Submit a prayer request:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Where it says "nickname" type your name or a nickname if you perfer anonymity.</li>
    <li>Choose the group you'd like to send the request to. Selecting Public will send it to all groups. Please do not
        send the prayer request to Testing.</li>
    <li>Enter your prayer request in the text box.</li>
