    <h3>What is a parish code?</h3>
    <p>Having a large group of people praying for you is incredibly powerful. However, sometimes you only want to share
        your concerns with a small group of people you know and trust. A parish code is a word or phrase, like STJOHNRE,
        that you can use to send to a specific group of people, such as your youth group or church congregation. If you
        enter a parish code, that prayer request will only go to the people in that group. Don't know a parish code, or
        want to send your request to the entire prayer chain? Don't worry, you can just leave the field blank and the
        request will go to everyone.</p>
